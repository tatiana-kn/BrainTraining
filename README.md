# BrainTraining App - Schulte Table

## Project Description
The BrainTraining App (Schulte Table) is an iOS mobile app. The primary goal of this app is to provide users with a brain training exercise in the form of a Schulte table. The app includes three difficulty levels: simple, classic, and difficult.

The Schulte Table is a grid filled with numbers that the user needs to find in numerical order as quickly as possible. This exercise helps improve concentration, attention, and cognitive skills.

The app includes a timer to track the time taken to complete the task, as well as a results table that shows the date and time of each test, the difficulty level selected, and the time taken to complete the task. This allows users to track their progress over time.
